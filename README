This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=671

Light background, gentle colours. Looks best on gvim, but
I've also tried to make it look reasonable on 16- and
8-colour terminals because I have to use those also. I
haven't been able to test on many different terminals
however.
